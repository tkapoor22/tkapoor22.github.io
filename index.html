        <p>
            This year has taken a turn none of us have expected. 
            However, I like to think of myself as an optimistic person and someone who prefers to look at the silver lining of each challenge. 
            Over the course of the last few months, I have lived in three different cities and this website will document some of my favorite meals in each city. 
        </p>

        <div class=p2>
        <p>
            However, before I take you all to the different cities, here's a little bit about me. 
            I'm currenly a junior in college and am taking all of my classes online. 
            I'm a huge foodie, as shown by the theme of this website, and my favorite cuisine is Italian. 
            I also have a really sweet tooth and favorite dessert has to be brownies, especially the boxed kind 
        </p>
        </div>

        <div class=p3>        
        <p>
            In each of the cities I lived in, I had such amazing food. 
            Moreover, since we all have been quarantining, most of the food was home cooked and I think everyone enjoys a good home cooked meal.  
            Now that I have told you a little bit about myself, let's jump ahead to the cities. 
        </p>
        </div>

            Cities I have lived in:
