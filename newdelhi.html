            Once my school announced we were going to have online classes in the fall, I flew from the US to the India. 
            This travel experience was one of the most long and challenging experiences I have had.

            Since I am currently living wiht grandparents, I have had a lot of good homecooked Indian food. 
            In fact, I have not had as much Indian food in the last two years than I have had in the last month. 
            However, I am now starting to crave other kinds of food, especially pasta.

            Beyond good Indian food, one of my aunts recenlty sent me homemade chocolate cake that is amazing. 
            My aunt is famous for her cakes in our family and so this week I have been having cake everyday after dinner, which I absolutely love.
