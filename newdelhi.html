            Once my school announced we were going to have online classes in the fall, I flew from the US to the India. 
            This travel experience was one of the most long and challenging journeys I have had.

            Since I am currently living with my grandparents, I have had a lot of good homecooked Indian food. 
            In fact, I have not had as much Indian food in the last two years than I have had in the last month. 
        </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            Beyond good Indian food, one of my aunts recenlty sent me an amazing chocolate cake.  
            Her cakes are famous in our family and so this week I have been having cake everyday after dinner, which I absolutely love.
