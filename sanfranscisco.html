            Last semester, I joined the Silicon Valley Program and lived in San Francisco. 
            Since we were not on campus and did not have dining halls, I had to learn how to cook.

        <p>
            I'm not a huge fan of cooking, in fact I find it stressful rather than relaxing. 
            As a result, I stuck to cooking easy things such as pasta or avocado toast. 
            Since italian is my favorite ciusine, I ended up making pasta quite often.

            However, one of my roommates enjoyed cooking and took over the menu, which was a blessing. 
            We made ended up making some really great beyond burgers,fried rice, buttered carrots, and stir fry.
