            Once my office started working from home, I moved to Dallas to live with some of cousins.
            In fact, I lived with two separate cousins in Dallas and had different food experinces with both.

            My first set of cousins absolutely loved cooking! 
            In fact, they made the best homemade pizza I have ever had. 
            We had a Thursday night ritual of making pizzas and I was in charge of grating the cheese. 
            This pizza was the perfect combination of Trader Joe's pizza crust, homemade sauce, and sharp cheddar cheese.

            At my other cousins' house, I enjoyed having amazing Indian food and paninis. 
            I also got to make boxed brownies every weekend, which was amazing.
