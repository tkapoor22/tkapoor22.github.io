            Once my office went to work from home mode, I moved to Dallas to live with some of cousins for a few weeks.
            In fact, I lived with two separate cousins in Dallas and had different food experinces in both.

            In the first house I lived, my cousins absolutely loved cooking. 
            Most distinctively, they made the best homemade pizza I have ever had. 
            In fact, it was a Thursday night ritual to make pizza. 
            This pizza was the perfect combination of Trader Joe's bread, homemade sauce, and sharp cheddar cheese.

        <div class=p3>
        <p>
            In the second house I lived in, I enjoyed having good homecooked Indian food and paninis. 
            I also got to make boxed brownies every weekend, which was amazing.
